With this information, the receiver should create a UDP server socket and wait forincoming  data  from  the  sender.   Any  error  in  parsing  the  arguments  or  creating  thesocket should result in an error, with an exit status of -1.  Once the first datagram isreceived from the sender, the receiver should ignore any subsequent datagrams fromother sources.As data chunks stream in, the receiver should keep track of the receive window andsend out acknowledgement datagrams. If a contiguous sequence of chunks at the baseof the window are received,  then the window should advance forward,  opening up anew set of chunks that the receiver will now accept. Any chunks that are received out oforder should be kept track of and selectively acknowledged.  Chunks that are receivedbeyond the limits of the receive window should be discarded.The receiver should immediately acknowledge any chunks, as soon as they are re-ceived. These acknowledgement datagrams should use the following format (also avail-able in the accompanying header file packet-format.h)s the format suggests, the acknowledgement message largely mirrors the receivewindow state.  The first field is a 32 bit integer (in network byte order order) which indi-cates the chunk sequence number of the base of the receive window. The second fieldis a 32 bit mask (also in network byte order), representing the selectively acknowledgedchunks, starting one position ahead of the receive window base (as the chunk at thebase itself can never have been received, as that would advance the window).The receiver should continue this procedure until all chunks are received and ac-knowledged, at which point it terminates with exit status 0.
